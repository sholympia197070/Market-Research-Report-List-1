<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wedge-shaped Lensed Fiber Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Mode Fiber</li><li>Multimode Fiber</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Wedge-shaped lensed fiber comes in two primary types: single mode fiber and multimode fiber. Single mode fiber features a small core diameter, allowing only one mode of light to propagate, which results in higher bandwidth and longer transmission distances. In contrast, multimode fiber has a larger core that supports multiple light modes, enabling shorter distances with increased light throughput. Both types cater to different applications, with single mode favored for long-distance telecommunications and multimode used in local area networks and short-range connectivity.</p></p>
