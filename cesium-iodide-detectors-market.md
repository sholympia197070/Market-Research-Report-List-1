<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cesium Iodide Detectors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Indirect Conversion</li><li>Direct Conversion</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cesium Iodide detectors are crucial in medical imaging, categorized into two main types: indirect and direct conversion. Indirect conversion detectors use a scintillation material like cesium iodide to convert X-rays into visible light, which is then captured by a photodetector. In contrast, direct conversion detectors convert X-rays directly into an electrical signal without an intermediate step. Both types have unique advantages; indirect conversion systems often show improved image quality, while direct systems enhance speed and efficiency in imaging applications.</p></p>
