<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Tire Pressure Monitor Control Modules Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wheel-Speed Based(Indirect TPMS)</li><li>Pressure-Sensor Based(Direct TPMS)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Tire Pressure Monitor Control Modules market is divided into two main types: Wheel-Speed Based (Indirect TPMS) and Pressure-Sensor Based (Direct TPMS). Indirect TPMS uses wheel speed sensors to estimate tire pressure by monitoring changes in tire rotation, making it cost-effective and less complex. In contrast, Direct TPMS relies on dedicated pressure sensors mounted within each tire to provide real-time pressure readings, offering precise monitoring. Both systems enhance vehicle safety and fuel efficiency by alerting drivers to low tire pressure conditions.</p></p>
