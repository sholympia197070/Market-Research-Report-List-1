<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Endotracheal Tube Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cuffed</li><li>Uncuffeds</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The endotracheal tube market is primarily categorized into cuffed and uncuffed tubes. Cuffed tubes have an inflatable cuff that seals the airway, preventing aspiration and ensuring ventilation, making them ideal for patients requiring mechanical ventilation. Uncuffed tubes, on the other hand, lack this feature and are often used in pediatric patients or specific surgical procedures where airway protection is less critical. The choice between the two types depends on patient needs, clinical settings, and the risk of aspiration.</p></p>
